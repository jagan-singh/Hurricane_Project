# Hurricane Project

## Data
We have used several different datasets and merged them together to get our final dataset. Our first dataset was put together in a paper by PNAS(Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences) in a paper Normalized US hurricane damage estimates using area of total destruction, 1900-2018.
